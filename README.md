# quadratic-farmula
Write a program that reads the coefficients, a, b and c of the quadratic equation ax²+bx+c=0 and prints the real solutions of x, using the following formula. 

x = -b±√b²-4ac /2a

Note that ifb-4ac0 then there is only one real solutions. If it is greater than zero then there are two real solutions and if it is less than zero then print the message "No Real Solutions".
